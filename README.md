## 🔍 Overview

This solution is built using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure security, scalability, and fault tolerance. It includes a layered architecture (Frontend, Backend, Database), auto-scaling, WAF protection, and CloudWatch monitoring.

## 🧩 Components

### 🛡 Security & Edge
- **Edge Layer WAF**: Protects against common web exploits (SQL injection, XSS).
- **Amazon CloudFront**: CDN for caching static content globally.
- **App Layer WAF**: Additional layer for app-specific protection.

### 🌐 Frontend
- **Application Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic to EC2 instances in public subnets.
- **Amazon EC2 (Frontend)**: Hosts the web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache).
- **Auto Scaling Group**: Ensures capacity adjusts to traffic demand.

### ⚙ Backend
- **Amazon EC2 (Backend)**: Runs business logic and APIs in private subnets.
- **Application Load Balancer**: Internal ALB to balance traffic between backend EC2 instances.

### 💾 Database
- **Amazon RDS (Primary & Standby)**: Multi-AZ deployment for fault-tolerant database service.
- **Private Subnets**: Isolated subnets to protect the database layer.

### 📢 Monitoring & Notifications
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Logs, metrics, and alarms.
- **Amazon SNS**: Sends alerts to admins/devs in case of failures or anomalies.

---

## 🔁 Data Flow

1. Users access the application via the Internet.
2. Traffic goes through **Edge WAF → CloudFront → App WAF**.
3. It enters the **VPC** through an **Internet Gateway** to the **Application Load Balancer**.
4. Requests are forwarded to **frontend EC2 instances**.
5. Backend requests are routed internally to **backend EC2 instances**.
6. Backend EC2 connects securely to **Amazon RDS** in private subnets.
7. Monitoring data flows to **CloudWatch**, and alerts are sent via **SNS**.

---

## 🔐 Security Measures

- **WAF (Edge & App)** for DDoS and threat mitigation.
- **Security Groups** restrict traffic at the instance level.
- **Private Subnets** for backend and database layers.
- **IAM Roles** control access to AWS services.

---

## ⚖ Scalability & High Availability

- **Multi-AZ** deployments for RDS.
- **Auto Scaling Groups** for frontend and backend.
- **Load Balancers** to ensure even traffic distribution.

---

## 💰 Cost Optimization

- **CloudFront caching** reduces backend load.
- **Auto Scaling** reduces unused resource cost.
- **NAT Gateway** used efficiently for backend access to the internet.
